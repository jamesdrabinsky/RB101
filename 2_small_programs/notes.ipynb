The second validation incorporates the `*` which stands for \"zero or more\", and the `?` which stands for \"zero or one\". This validation can be read as \"zero or more digits, followed by an optional period, followed by zero or more digits. This validation will accept all of these formats: 11.11, 11., .11, but not a period by itself. Notice that we had to prefix the `.` with a backslash.
